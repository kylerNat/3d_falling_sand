magic handles that have n-buttons
wire buttons to crystals to design wands
magic juice flows from button through wires when you activate them
magic juice contains information about projectiles, when it reaches an exit it fires the projectile
crystals:
    material crystals, imbues projectile with material
    kinetic crystal, causes your wand to move when activated, useful for creating melee attacks
    logic crsyal
    containment crystal, allows you to put projectiles inside projectiles (ie create trigger projectiles)

nerves connect brain to joints, the connection just lets the brain know the joint exists and that it can be controlled
the brain figures out how to move the joint based in the joint type

brain can magically apply forces to the aether, which allows air strafign and slow/fast falling, or flight for sufficiently small creatures

format
10 bits - material index
 4 bits - distance field
 2 bits - corner/edge/face/middle, or maybe sharpness?


joint - 2 voxels in 2 bodies
brain - 1 voxel and a tree/graph of bodies
