magic handles that have n-buttons
wire buttons to crystals to design wands
magic juice flows from button through wires when you activate them
magic juice contains information about projectiles, when it reaches an exit it fires the projectile
crystals:
    material crystals, imbues projectile with material
    kinetic crystal, causes your wand to move when activated, useful for creating melee attacks
    logic crsyal
    containment crystal, allows you to put projectiles inside projectiles (ie create trigger projectiles)

nerves connect brain to joints, the connection just lets the brain know the joint exists and that it can be controlled
the brain figures out how to move the joint based in the joint type

brain can magically apply forces to the aether, which allows air strafign and slow/fast falling, or flight for sufficiently small creatures

voxel format
red channel
8 bits - material index

green channel
5 bits - distance field
2 bits - material phase

blue channel
2 bit  - temporary voxel, used to for particles temporarily inserted for interaction and rendering
4 bits - temperature
2 bit  - electrical energy

alpha channel
6 bits - color variant

material properties:
density


joint - 2 voxels in 2 bodies
brain - 1 voxel and a tree/graph of bodies

genetics system:
base pairs are made of elements, and determine your required "diet"
